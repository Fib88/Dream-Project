# Dream-Project

### *This readme contains simple instructions regarding my dream project*

*Because if you do what you love you will never work another day*

### My dream project is a combination of the things I like to do:

| MY        | DREAM           | PROJECT  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Fitness      | A big part of my life  | 20% |
| MUSIC      | If I cant have music I might die      |   30% |
| CODING | I'm excited to learn how to code      |  50% |

*Admittedly I recently came accross a project on reddit that would use spotify's API to
generate a playlist based on the current mood of the user. Now my project would be similar
only that it would generate a playlist based on the sport or type of training of the user*
